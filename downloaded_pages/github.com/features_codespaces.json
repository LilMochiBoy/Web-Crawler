Learn how GitHub’s Engineering Team builds with Codespaces Read more “ What used to be a 15-step process is just one step: open Codespaces and you’re off and running. Clint Chester Developer Lead, Synergy “ Codespaces lets developers skip the tedious, error-prone stuff that normally stands between them and getting started on real work. Keith Annette Cloud Capability Lead, KPMG, UK Start coding in seconds with Codespaces Get started for free Frequently asked questions How does Codespaces work? A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. Customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by configuring dev container files to your repository (often known as configuration-as-code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project. GitHub Codespaces run on a various VM-based compute options hosted by GitHub.com, which you can configure from 2 core machines up to 32 core machines. Connect to your codespaces from the browser or locally using an IDE like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ. How do I use Codespaces? There are a number of entry points to spin up a Codespaces environment, including: A template . Your repository for new feature work An open pull request to explore work-in-progress A commit in the repository's history to investigate a bug at a specific point in time Visual Studio Code In beta, can you also use your JetBrains IDE or JupyterLab Learn more about how to use Codespaces in our documentation . Is Codespaces available for individual developers? Codespaces is available for developers in every organization, and under the control of the organization who pays for the user's codespace. All personal (individual) GitHub.com accounts include a quota of free usage each month, which organizations can enable (see the next question) for their private and internal repositories. GitHub will provide users in the free plan 120 core hours or 60 hours of run time on a 2 core codespace, plus 15 GB of storage each month. See how it's balanced on the billing page . Is Codespaces available for teams and companies? Codespaces is available for teams and companies, but needs to be enabled first in an organization’s settings. Teams and companies can select which repositories and users have access to Codespaces for added security and permissioning control. Learn how to enable Codespaces in an organization in our docs . How much does Codespaces cost? Codespaces is free for individual use up to 60 hours a month and comes with simple, pay-as-you-go pricing after that. It’s also available for organizations with pay-as-you-go pricing and has pricing controls so any company or team can determine how much they want to spend a month. Learn more about Codespaces pricing for organizations here . Can I self-host Codespaces? Codespaces cannot be self-hosted. How do I access Codespaces with LinkedIn Learning? You can use Codespaces directly through Lin...",
